# Here Comes Niko! Archipelago WIP
This mod integrates [Archipelago](https://archipelago.gg/) into Here Comes Niko! and randomizes a bunch of different things

Here Comes Niko! apworld: [Latest apworld](https://github.com/niieli/Niko-Archipelago/releases/latest)

## Installation

1. Download and install [BepInEx 5.4.x](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.22) in your Here Comes Niko root folder. 
2. Start the game once so that BepInEx creates its stuff
3. Download the latest zip from the [release page](https://github.com/niieli/NikoArchipelagoMod/releases/latest) and extract its content into `BepInEx/plugins`

## Connecting

After loading into the game press the Archipelago icon in the middle of the screen and adjust everything to your liking.

Then click 'Connect' and you should load into Home with a blank save. 

(If you already have a save with the same address, port, name and seed, it will load into that one instead)

You can delete Archipelago saves at `...\AppData\LocalLow\Frog Vibes\Here Comes Niko!\Archipelago` (not sure for other systems)

## Known issues

- Apples & Snail Money get duplicated after reconnecting (Not a big deal, but will try to find a fix)
